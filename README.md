# Wireframing in the Design Process

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic, skeletal outline of a website or application. It focuses on the structure, layout, and placement of elements rather than on visual design aspects such as colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes serve as a blueprint that helps designers, developers, and stakeholders understand how users will interact with a product.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process because it:

- **Translates ideas into visuals**: Turns abstract concepts into tangible representations.  
- **Encourages collaboration**: Acts as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Identifies usability issues early**: Highlights potential user experience challenges before moving to high-fidelity designs.  
- **Saves time and effort**: Makes it easier to experiment with changes compared to altering finalized designs.  

wireframing is the foundation for building user-friendly and well-structured digital products.
